A system to manage multiple Bluetooth-based marketing campaigns (placecasting) that allows to send any supported file (images, text, music) to near Bluetooth devices. It includes a daemon that runs in the background and provides a D-Bus service to allow the development of different frontends (actually a Qt gui is included).

It depends, at least, on:
  * dbus-1
  * bluez 3.18
  * qt 4.3
  * obexftp 0.19

This software is still considered in **Alpha** state, it's only available through [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/btam/source)
